# rendering
Use my fork of [vapory](https://github.com/steakelum/vapory) if you want to run these locally.

`render.py` is used like a library, don't edit it unless you really want to.

`points.py` contains a brief example that generates this short rendering:

![Example](animation.gif?raw=true)

It also requires `FFmpeg` and the `FFmpy` python library.
