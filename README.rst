rendering
========
Use my fork of `vapory <https://github.com/steakelum/vapory/>`_ if you want to run these locally. `render.py` is used like a library, don't edit it unless you really want to. `points.py` contains a brief example that generates this short rendering:

It also requires ``FFmpeg`` and the ``FFmpy`` python library.
